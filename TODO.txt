09.10.2017:
	1. Intoduction should be a little longer ~ 5 pages
	2. Introduction should additionally contain: problems, detailed research quesion
	3. In the application chapter, a short overview of how the etire application looks
	4. Move the precision+recall table inside the paper
	5. Conclusion should be longer (~5 pages) and contain: comparison of theory and practice, best practices.

	EMPIRIC
	--------------
	1. Try more SVM classifiers
	2. read about and calculate Precision, Recall and F-Measure as measures for Success rate (and confusion matrix)
	3. If classifivation results dont improve, try training with equal parts News and Not-News
	4. Look up auto-tune methods for classifier parameters (in cross-validation maybe)

	STRUCTURE
	----------------------
	5. Methodology (Theory) should be about as large as Application
	6. Build 2 axes for sorting classifiers and describe all classifiers along those 2 measures
	7. Add 'Research Question Statement'
	8. At the end of application, there shoul be a mini-Conclussion:
	9. The Summary should contain something about future-research

31.08.2017:
	- Finish building the results data wit hall possible varaitions of:
		- Data set size
		- Amount of features
	- Derive correlation between all above factors
	- Observe the quality/time ratio
	- try live classification and how it compares to human labeling (in real time)

28.06.2017:
	- continue working on word_as_features 
	- do something about ratios between news/spam when counting word

26.06.2017:
	- performed examination by neural networks networks parameters for training classifiers (algo and activation)
	- activation = 'tanh' seems to perform better

09.06.2017
	1. Clear duplicates
	2. Check for Overfitting
	3. Explore other properties of Confidence
	4. Examine False-Negatives/-Positives classification

31.05.2017:
	- write Andreas an email regarding a meeting (w. Uli in skype) on Friday(before 1pm) -DONE
	- try other classifiers
	- inspect the diffrence between w. Preprocessing and without
	- complete the collecting of 10k tweets
	- visual representation of Random forests
	- try using a manual trainig/testing split - so an average confidence could be established

29.05.2017
	-collect more tweets, prefrebly heterogenous - goal: 10k
	-start writing, maybe start with definitions of the different classifier types
	-read on the book about ML in Python
	-filter GUI

28.03.2017:
	- changed python version to 3.5.2 (64bit), because no tensorflow support for 3.6.x

27.03.2017:
	- Sentdex tutorials on youtube <Data Analysis with Python and Pandas>
