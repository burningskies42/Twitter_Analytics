The purpose of the thesis is to reseach possible methods, which would allow to classify "infomative posts"
from junk posts. Several machine learning algorithems are to be tested (through implementation in python).

Possible methods to try:

1. Linear regression - less for classification, more for general analysis of features

Supervised learning:
2. K - nearest neighbours
3. Support Vector Machines (hard margin)
4. SVM (soft margins - cost function for outliers)
5. SVM With different kernels

Clustering:
6. K-means (super vised learning) 
7. Mean Shift (unsupervised learning)
