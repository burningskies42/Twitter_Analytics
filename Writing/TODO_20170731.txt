EMPIRIC
--------------
1. Try more SVM classifiers
2. read about and calculate Precision, Recall and F-Measure as measures for Success rate (and confusion matrix)
3. If classifivation results dont improve, try training with equal parts News and Not-News
4. Look up auto-tune methods for classifier parameters (in cross-validation maybe)

STRUCTURE
----------------------
5. Methodology (Theory) should be about as large as Application
6. Build 2 axes for sorting classifiers and describe all classifiers along those 2 measures
7. Add 'Research Question Statement'
8. At the end of application, there shoul be a mini-Conclussion:
9. The Summary should contain something about future-research
